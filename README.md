## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹, 

My name is Mauricio, and I am a researcher with more than **nine years of experience** in the development of mathematical models, ranging from differential equations to machine-learning models. Most of the models I used in the first few years were applied to the field of environmental biotechnology, mostly focused on anaerobic digestion. Over the last four years I have also applied mathematical models to public health epidemiology, developing compartmental models to inform decision-making, evaluating public health interventions and vaccination strategies.

I am an avid learner and recently I have became way more interested in the application of Machine Learning models, and also I have focused into incorporating concepts from Software Engineering (e.g. unit testing, code readability) into my work. Currently I am focused about learning a whole lot about Machine Learning, particularly in the deployment of models for production.

**My most relevant technical skills**

These are the hightlights of the skills I consider the keystone of my abilities:

- I am proficient in three different languages: **Python, R and MATLAB**.
- I have shown the ability to adapt the application of mathematical models to different domains.

**Some of the things I have built**

- A [mathematical framework] to compute the yields of ATP in microbial pathways. The results were visualized in a MATLAB application. This code would really need probably a translation and re-factoring into Python.
- An [online simulator tool] to visualize the results of a compartmental model to evaluate the spread of COVID-19
- A [live dashboard] to showcase simulation results from a bioreactor.
- [Formal reports] for healthcare decision makers evaluating hospitalization risks between variants.
