### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹, 

My name is Mauricio, and I am an Environmental Scientist that fell in love with programming and became a mathematical modeler. I have over ten years of experience developing models in the field of biotechnology, mostly focused on anaerobic digestion. Over the last four years I have also worked developing compartmental models starting with the COVID-19 pandemic and then focusing on other diseases. In addition, I have also worked with heavy datasets from healthcare data.

I am an avid learner and recently I have became way more interested in the application of Machine Learning models, and also I have focused into incorporating concepts from Software Engineering (e.g. unit testing, code readability) into my work. Currently I am focused about learning a whole lot about Machine Learning, particularly in the deployment of models for production.

**My most relevant technical skills**
These are the hightlights of the skills I consider the keystone of my abilities:

- I have versatility in three different languages such as MATLAB, but also R and Python.
- I have a lot of experience in the development of mathematical models applied to microbial growth.
- I want to focus on the application of the models as they need to be useful tools for people that uses that information (e.g. decision-makers)

**Some of the things I have built**
- A [mathematical framework] to compute the yields of ATP in microbial pathways. The results were visualized in a MATLAB application. This code would really need probably a translation and re-factoring into Python.
- An [online simulator tool] to visualize the results of a compartmental model to evaluate the spread of COVID-19
- A [live dashboard] to showcase simulation results from a bioreactor.
- [Formal reports] for healthcare decision makers evaluating hospitalization risks between variants.
